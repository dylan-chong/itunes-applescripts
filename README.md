# iTunes AppleScripts
Useful JavaScript AppleScripts I make for batch-altering iTunes track data. Inspired by [scripts by Doug Adams](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php)

If you import lots of music into your iTunes library and you want your track data to be perfect, don't alter them by hand! Use scripts! A combination of [scripts by Doug Adams](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php) and my own work really well. If there's a script I haven't made, don't worry, I make scripts all the time! 

[Email me](mailto:dylanchongit@gmail.com?Subject=iTunes%20AppleScripts%3A) any script requests here.

Feel free to use and modify yourself! Just keep them free to use.<br>
but **be careful - please backup your music before using**

<h2> Instructions for Use </h2>
1. Download a script (to a Mac with your iTunes library)
2. Make a copy of the tracks you want to apply the script to
3. Select the tracks in iTunes
3. Double click the script (opens the Script Editor)
4. Set language to JavaScript (from AppleScript) at the top left of the editor
5. Click the run button (the triangle)
6. Done!
