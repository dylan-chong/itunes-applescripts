# iTunes AppleScripts
Useful JavaScript AppleScripts I make for batch-altering iTunes track data. Inspired by [scripts by Doug Adams](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php)

If you import lots of music into your iTunes library and you want your track data to be perfect, don't alter them by hand! Use scripts! A combination of [scripts by Doug Adams](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/index.php) and my own work really well. If there's a script I haven't made, don't worry, I make scripts all the time! 

[Email me](mailto:dylanchongit@gmail.com?Subject=iTunes%20AppleScripts%3A) any script requests here.

Feel free to use and modify yourself! Just keep them free to use.<br>
but **be careful - please backup your track data before using**
